# Git Workflow

## Branch Strategy

**Always work on the `draft` branch first, then merge to `main`.**

- **draft** – Branch for all new content and changes. Pages CMS edits this branch.
- **main** – Production branch. Deployed to the live site. Updated by merging from draft.

## Workflow

1. **Start on draft**: `git checkout draft` before making changes
2. **Commit to draft**: All new commits go to draft
3. **Push draft**: `git push origin draft`
4. **Publish**: Use the auto-merge workflow (or manual merge) to merge draft → main

## Important

- Do **not** commit directly to `main` — content added there won't appear in Pages CMS (which reads from draft)
- To sync draft with main (e.g., after accidental direct commits to main): merge main into draft, then push draft
