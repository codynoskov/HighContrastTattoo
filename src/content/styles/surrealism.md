## Beyond the Real

Surrealist tattooing taps into the subconscious, creating images that exist in the space between dreams and waking life. Inspired by artists like Salvador Dalí and René Magritte, these tattoos juxtapose familiar objects in impossible ways, distort scale and perspective, and invite viewers into worlds where the rules of reality no longer apply.

## Personal Mythology

What makes Surrealism powerful as a tattoo style is its ability to externalize inner worlds. These pieces often carry deep personal meaning, translating complex emotions, memories, and ideas into visual metaphors. A melting clock, an eye in unexpected places, figures transforming into other forms—each element becomes part of a personal mythology written on skin.
