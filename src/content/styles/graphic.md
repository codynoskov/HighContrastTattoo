## Design as Art

Graphic tattooing approaches the body as a designer would approach a canvas—with an eye for composition, negative space, and visual impact. These pieces often incorporate abstract shapes, bold color blocks, and elements borrowed from poster art, typography, and modern graphic design. The result is tattoo work that feels contemporary and intentional.

## Breaking Conventions

This style isn't bound by traditional tattoo imagery or techniques. Graphic tattoos might feature geometric abstractions, deconstructed forms, or unexpected color combinations. They embrace the principles of modern design—balance, contrast, rhythm—while creating something entirely unique to the medium of skin and ink.
