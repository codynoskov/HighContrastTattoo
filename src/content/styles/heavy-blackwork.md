Heavy Blackwork uses large areas of pure black, blackout sections and big abstract forms. This style is for people who want to fully change part of the body, cover old tattoos or enjoy a very bold, graphic look. In our studio in Berlin-Friedrichshain, our artists plan heavy blackwork projects step by step, deciding which areas will be black and which will stay as skin, and building designs that can wrap an arm, leg or torso. If you like minimalism, strong silhouettes and fearless tattoo ideas, heavy blackwork is one of the most powerful tools.
