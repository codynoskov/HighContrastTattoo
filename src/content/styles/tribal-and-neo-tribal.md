name: Tribal & Neo-Tribal
slugOverride: tribal-and-neo-tribal
order: 15
intro: Powerful black tattoos built from rhythmic, body-following patterns.
details: Tribal & Neo-Tribal tattoos use big black areas, curves and repeated
  shapes inspired by traditional body markings, but drawn in a modern way.
  People choose this style to show strength, movement and energy on the
  shoulders, chest, back, hips or legs. In our studio in Berlin-Friedrichshain,
  our artists design each pattern to follow muscles and joints so the tattoo
  moves with the body and supports its form. If you want a bold black tattoo
  without detailed pictures, but with a clear and powerful silhouette, Tribal
  and Neo-Tribal are ideal.
