## Where It All Began

Traditional tattooing, also known as Old School or American Traditional, represents the bedrock of Western tattoo culture. Born in the early 20th century and popularized by legends like Sailor Jerry and Bert Grimm, this style is defined by thick black outlines, a limited but vibrant color palette, and imagery steeped in nautical, military, and Americana symbolism.

## Built to Last

There's a reason Traditional tattoos have endured for over a century. The bold lines and solid color fills aren't just aesthetic choices—they're practical ones, creating tattoos that age gracefully and remain readable for decades. Anchors, roses, eagles, pin-up girls, and hearts aren't just designs; they're icons that carry generations of meaning and craftsmanship.
