I had two sessions with the incredibly talented Nastia, and I couldn't be happier with the beautiful piece she created. A brilliant cover that couldn't have gone better. She also made me feel super comfortable during the whole process.

The space is pristine, delightful y decorated and cosy, creating a relaxed and welcoming vibe.

Worth the travel to visit Nastya and get an astonishing tattoo 🖤
