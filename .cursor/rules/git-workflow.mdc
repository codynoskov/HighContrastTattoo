# Git Workflow

## Branch Strategy

**Always push to `draft` first, then merge to `main`.** Never commit or push directly to main.

- **draft** – Staging branch. Client edits in Pages CMS use draft. All changes go here first.
- **main** – Production branch. Deployed to the live site. Only updated by merging from draft.

## Workflow

1. **Work on draft**: `git checkout draft` before making changes
2. **Commit and push draft**: `git add ... && git commit ... && git push origin draft`
3. **Publish**: Merge draft → main (manual or via auto-merge workflow)

## Important

- **Never** push directly to `main`. Always: push to draft → merge draft to main.
- Do **not** commit directly to main — the client works in draft via Pages CMS.
- To sync draft with main: merge main into draft, then push draft.
