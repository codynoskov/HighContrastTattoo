I’m Zohar, also working under the name Useless Treasures. My tattoos sit somewhere between surreal illustration and pop art, strange creatures, plants, symbols, and characters inspired by nature, underground culture, and the weirder sides of everyday life. I’m drawn to designs that feel a little unexpected, but stay bold, clear, and readable on the skin.  
I build my designs as illustrative, graphic compositions, then push them toward surreal or neo-traditional structures depending on what the idea calls for. Floral and botanical elements often appear in my work, often with a twist: flowers growing from odd objects, merging with pop culture references, or forming surreal hybrids. I care a lot about how a tattoo moves with the body, the flow, direction, and negative space are designed to follow the arm, leg, or torso, not just sit flat.  
I focus on original, custom designs and aim for each tattoo to feel like a one-of-a-kind work of art that still holds up years down the line. If you’re into surreal tattoos with botanical elements and a darker, conceptual edge, you can see more of my work and available designs on my Instagram.
