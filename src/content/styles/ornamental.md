## The Body as Canvas

Ornamental tattooing treats the skin as a surface for decoration in its purest sense. Drawing inspiration from architectural details, textile patterns, jewelry design, and decorative arts from cultures worldwide, these tattoos adorn the body with intricate patterns that enhance and celebrate its natural form. Like permanent jewelry, they transform the wearer into a walking work of decorative art.

## Pattern and Placement

What makes Ornamental tattooing distinctive is its attention to how designs interact with the body's architecture. These pieces often follow the lines of bones and muscles, frame natural curves, or create symmetry across the body. The patterns themselves—whether inspired by baroque scrollwork, mehndi, or geometric abstractions—serve to beautify and ornament rather than represent specific imagery.
