Blackwork uses only solid black ink, bold shapes and clear contrast. It works well for people who want tattoos that really stand out in everyday life. In our Friedrichshain shop in Berlin, our blackwork artists create ornaments, abstract designs, figures, masks, totems and other symbolic images that look good in one colour. This style is perfect for sleeves, back pieces, big leg tattoos and for covering old work when you need a clear, powerful result.
