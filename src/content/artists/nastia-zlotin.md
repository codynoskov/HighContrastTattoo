Hi, I’m Nastia. I own High Contrast Tattoo Berlin together with my husband Ed. I’ve been tattooing for over 13 years, working mainly with neo-traditional and colour tattoos. I enjoy building bright, carefully composed pieces that feel elegant and personal instead of generic. For me, a good tattoo should reflect something real about the person wearing it, their personality, their story, their taste.

Cover-ups are a big part of my work and something I genuinely care about. I’m happy to take on difficult projects that other artists may have turned down: heavy, dark or awkward old tattoos that need a smart solution, not just more ink on top. I like figuring out how much of the old piece we need to hide, where we can use it as a base and how to build a new design that looks intentional rather than like a rescue mission.

Style-wise, I move between Neo Traditional, Floral & Botanic, Art Nouveau and Illustrative design. I often lean towards a feminine look, flowing lines, floral elements, soft shapes and layered colour, but that doesn’t mean I only do “girly” tattoos. I’m just as happy to design pieces for men and for anyone who doesn’t fit into simple gender boxes. It doesn’t matter what your body type is or how you identify; my focus is on finding a design that fits you, sits well on your body and makes you feel good when you see it in the mirror.

Whether you’re coming in for a fresh piece or to cover something you don’t like anymore, I put a lot of attention into balance, composition and detail. The goal is always the same: to create a tattoo that feels like it belongs to you and makes you feel at home in your own skin.
