  At High Contrast Tattoo, we care about more than just how a tattoo looks. We
  want you to feel good from the moment you walk in until you leave the studio
  happy with your new tattoo. Our studio is friendly and relaxed, with high
  standards for both quality and hygiene.


  We take time to listen to your idea, talk it through together and then turn it
  into a clear, well-planned design. Every tattoo is done carefully and cleanly,
  and we always try to make the session as comfortable as possible, whether it
  is your first tattoo or your tenth.
