name: Ornamental
slugOverride: ornamental
order: 18
intro: Decorative tattoos that feel like jewellery or architectural detail on
  the skin.
details: "Ornamental tattoos focus on decorative lines and shapes: filigree,
  lace, scrolls and jewel like elements. This style is perfect for highlighting
  the natural lines of the body, such as collarbones, chest, neck, stomach,
  shoulders, hips and hands. In our Berlin Friedrichshain studio, our artists
  design pieces that feel like necklaces, bracelets, ornamental collars or
  detailed borders, customised to your shape. If you want elegant tattoos
  without characters but with a strong focus on form and beauty, ornamental work
  is a very good option."
