slugOverride: dotwork
order: 13
intro: Tattoos built entirely from dots, with soft gradients and texture.
details: Dotwork builds images using dots to create soft gradients, texture and
  gentle volume. At our studio in Berlin-Friedrichshain, we often use this style
  for sacred geometry, mandalas, ornaments and big abstract projects. Almost any
  tattoo idea, from small symbols and words to large scenes on the arm, leg or
  back, can be done in dotwork and will look more graphic and unique. Our
  artists control the density of dots so the design fits the body and its
  movement. If you like detailed patterns and calm, precise visuals, dotwork is
  a great option.
