My style is heavy, gooey blackwork and lettering. I like abstract, expressive shapes that don’t try to be polite and will stand out immediately from other tattoos around them. Think big, hellish meat, distorted forms and dark aesthetics rather than clean, “pretty” pictures.

I work a lot with freehand, which means I draw the design directly on your body instead of just placing a stencil. That lets me follow your muscles and bone structure so the lines and blocks of black actually move with you. Most pieces end up somewhere between Heavy Blackwork, abstract blackwork and obscure dark imagery, with calligraphic elements or script when it fits.

If you’re looking for soft, delicate tattoos, I’m probably not your artist. But if you want something intense, strange and built specifically for your body, a piece of black that looks like it belongs only to you, then we can create that together.
