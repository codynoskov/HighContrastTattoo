## Garden on Skin

Floral and Botanic tattooing celebrates the endless variety and beauty of the plant world. From realistic botanical illustrations that could grace a scientific text to stylized interpretations that capture the essence of a bloom, these tattoos bring nature's artistry to the human form. Each flower carries its own symbolism, its own story, its own beauty.

## Timeless Subjects, Endless Interpretations

Flowers have been tattoo subjects for as long as tattooing has existed, yet the genre continues to evolve. Contemporary botanical tattoos might embrace photorealism, minimalist linework, watercolor effects, or bold traditional styling. The subject matter—roses, peonies, wildflowers, ferns, branches—provides a canvas for virtually any artistic approach.
