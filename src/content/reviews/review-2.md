**Ed**, our tattoo artist has been very attentive, friendly and competent. We felt very safe. Our tattoos, the very first ones, turn**ed** out to be beautiful and exactly how I and my husband imagin**ed** it. Just lovely. Getting an appointment was also easy. The studio has a great, bright atmosphere and the other artists have been very friendly too.
