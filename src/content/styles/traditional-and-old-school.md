Traditional & Old School is the classic tattoo look: anchors, hearts, ships, snakes, roses, swallows, pin-ups and eagles. In our Berlin studio we tattoo this style every week. It uses thick outlines, a small set of colours and very clear shapes, so these tattoos stay readable for many years. Clients choose it for its vintage feeling, sailor and biker roots and direct visual language. If you want tried and tested tattoo ideas or a traditional sleeve, this style is a safe and strong option.
