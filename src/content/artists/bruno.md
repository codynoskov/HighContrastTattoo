Hi, I’m Bruno, a Brazilian tattoo artist focusing mainly on Blackwork and graphic, illustrative pieces. For me, tattooing is a way to show who we are and how we change over time — a visible record of our inner movement. I’m especially drawn to nature, faces and organic shapes, and I like to translate them into designs that feel calm, structured and visually fresh, guided by what makes sense to me artistically.

I work across Blackwork, Linework, Illustrative, Graphic and Surrealism, so I can keep a design very reduced and linear, push it into heavy black and strong contrast, or build more abstract compositions with texture, negative space and flow. I pay a lot of attention to how a tattoo sits on the body: following muscles, wrapping around joints and staying legible from a distance. The goal is always the same, to turn your idea into a piece that fits you, feels balanced on the skin and still looks good many years from now.
