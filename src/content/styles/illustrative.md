  - title: "Drawing Meets Tattooing"
    paragraphs:
      - "Illustrative tattooing bridges the gap between fine art and skin. Artists in this style bring strong drawing fundamentals to every piece, treating the body as a canvas for expressive, hand-drawn aesthetics."
      - "The result often feels like a page torn from a sketchbook and made permanent — maintaining the spontaneity and character of drawn work while adapting to the unique requirements of tattoo art."

  - title: "Personal Expression"
    paragraphs:
      - "More than any other style, illustrative work allows for deeply personal expression. Each artist's hand is visible in the work — their quirks, their influences, their visual language all come through in the final piece."
      - "This makes artist selection particularly important. Clients should seek out artists whose existing work resonates with them, knowing that personal style will infuse every custom design."
  - title: "Narrative Potential"
    paragraphs:
      - "Illustrative tattoos excel at storytelling. Whether depicting scenes, characters, or symbolic imagery, this style can communicate complex ideas and emotions in ways more structured approaches cannot."
      - "The flexibility of illustration allows for blending influences — from comic book aesthetics to classical drawing to contemporary graphic design — creating truly unique pieces that defy easy categorization."
