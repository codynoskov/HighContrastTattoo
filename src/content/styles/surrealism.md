Surrealism tattoos combine realistic parts with strange and dreamlike ideas: melting objects, floating bodies, unusual landscapes and symbolic scenes. People choose this style when they want deeper meaning, emotion and a strong personal story in their tattoo. In our Friedrichshain studio in Berlin, our team turns fears, wishes, memories and private stories into complex surreal images. If you want something different from "just a picture" and like bold, creative ideas, surrealism gives you a lot of freedom.
