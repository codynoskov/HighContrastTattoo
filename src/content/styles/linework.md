name: "Linework"
description: "This approach is built around clarity, precision, and visual restraint. Instead of relying on shading or color, the entire composition is carried by line alone. The focus is on structure, balance, and rhythm, resulting in tattoos that feel clean, intentional, and timeless."

  - title: "Precision & Clarity"
    paragraphs:
      - "Linework tattooing strips away everything but the essential: the line. Without shading or color to rely on, every stroke must be deliberate, every curve intentional. This constraint forces a level of precision that defines the entire approach."
      - "The result is work that reads clearly at any distance and ages gracefully over time. By focusing on structure rather than texture, linework tattoos maintain their impact as the skin naturally changes."

  - title: "Rhythm & Balance"
    paragraphs:
      - "Great linework creates visual rhythm through the repetition and variation of line weights, spacing, and curves. Like musical composition, the tattoo develops a tempo that guides the eye through the design."
      - "Balance doesn't mean symmetry — it means thoughtful distribution of visual weight. A single bold line can anchor an entire composition of delicate details, creating dynamic tension that holds attention."
  - title: "Timeless Appeal"
    paragraphs:
      - "The simplicity of linework gives it an enduring quality. While trends in tattooing shift constantly, clean lines never go out of style. These tattoos look as contemporary now as they will in decades."
      - "This approach also adapts beautifully to any scale. From small, discrete pieces to expansive full-sleeve designs, the principles of linework translate across every format."
