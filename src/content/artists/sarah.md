Hey, I’m Sarah, a beginner tattoo artist with roots in Castrop-Rauxel and a big love for black ink, bold shapes and classic tattoo imagery. My style currently sits somewhere between Blackwork and Traditional & Old School: strong outlines, simple forms and clear, high contrast designs, often supported by straightforward Linework.

Because I’m still at the start of my tattoo journey, I care a lot about doing things properly and taking time with each piece. What matters most to me is that you feel comfortable, not just with the finished tattoo, but with the whole process around it: talking through ideas, choosing the placement, preparing the stencil, taking breaks if you need them and checking in on how you feel during the session.

If you want to get to know me, my work and my personality, you can find me on Instagram at @sarah\_rawk. For tattoo content only, without personal posts, check out @sarah\_rawk\_tattoo.
