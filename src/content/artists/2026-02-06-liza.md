Hi, I’m Liza. I’m mostly drawn to dark graphics, black ink and shadows. My style sits somewhere between bio-organic and ornamental tattooing: flowing shapes that follow and enhance the anatomy, sometimes resembling bones, roots or other organic forms. Most of my work leans towards blackwork and abstract blackwork rather than colour.

I usually create larger, cohesive pieces instead of small standalone tattoos, for example full sections of an arm or leg, back pieces or projects that grow over time. I love working freehand, because it lets the design move naturally with your individual body, turning the tattoo into something that really feels built into you. When it fits the project, I am also happy to plan custom concepts in advance with sketches and references.

For me, it is important that every tattoo is personal and not just another trend. You can choose something from my flash sheets or we can create a custom tattoo from scratch; I am always open to a collaborative process and to hearing your ideas. I do not like forcing designs into standard, overused styles. I see tattooing as art, and art should be individual and unique. If you connect with dark aesthetics, clean black ink and forms that become part of the body, I would be happy to work together on your next piece.
