## The Evolution of a Classic

Neo Traditional tattooing takes the foundational principles of American Traditional—bold outlines, solid color fills, and iconic imagery—and pushes them into new creative territory. Artists working in this style expand the color palette beyond the classic primary tones, introduce more complex shading techniques, and bring a heightened level of detail to every piece.

## Where Heritage Meets Innovation

What sets Neo Traditional apart is its willingness to experiment while honoring the past. You'll find the same respect for clean, readable designs that age well, but with contemporary subject matter and artistic influences ranging from Art Nouveau to modern illustration. The result is tattoo work that feels both timeless and fresh—rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern.
