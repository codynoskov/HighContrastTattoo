Hi, I’m Arseniy. I come from the hardcore punk scene and I’ve been tattooing since 2013. That background shaped how I see tattooing: direct, honest and built on strong fundamentals rather than decoration for its own sake. Over time I naturally gravitated towards Traditional & Old School tattooing, where clear symbols, bold outlines and simple, effective colour do most of the talking.

Most of my work is classic traditional and old school: strong black, solid shading, limited palettes and designs that stay easy to read once they’re healed and aged. I like flash-style pieces, small bangers and mid-sized tattoos that feel like proper “tattoos” rather than fragile illustrations, but I also enjoy larger projects when the idea needs more space, full sleeves, back pieces, chest/front pieces and other multi-session work built around a clear structure. We can also plan sessions with a few palm-size tattoos in one sitting if you’re building a patchwork layout or simply want to get more done at once.

At the same time, I also work in Linework, Fineline, Single Needle and White on Black, so I can keep things more minimal when needed, add finer details in smaller areas or push a design into stronger contrast with white over black. You can choose something straight from my flash sheets if you want a quick traditional piece, or we can sit down and turn your idea into a custom design that still follows old school logic: clear silhouette, good placement and enough black to hold everything together. My focus in every session is clean execution, simple structure and tattoos that still make sense on the body many years from now.
