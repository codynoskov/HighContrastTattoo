name: Blackwork
slugOverride: blackwork
order: 3
intro: Bold, high-impact tattoos created with solid black ink.
details: Blackwork uses only solid black ink, bold shapes and clear contrast. It
  works well for people who want tattoos that really stand out in everyday life.
  In our Friedrichshain shop in Berlin, our blackwork artists create ornaments,
  abstract designs, figures, masks, totems and other symbolic images that look
  good in one colour. This style is perfect for sleeves, back pieces, big leg
  tattoos and for covering old work when you need a clear, powerful result.
