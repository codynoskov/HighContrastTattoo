Hiya and welcome to this little “Get to Know Me” section! I’ve been working as a professional tattoo artist since 2019 and joined the High Contrast family in October 2024. My style is largely illustrative and floats along the Neo Traditional spectrum; it follows clear, flowing structures that complement the body, and is brought to life by a selection of colours that feel earthy and natural rather than hyper-saturated. Of course my designs can be easily adapted to your preferences, as well – whether that's a soft colour piece, a more subtle black and grey motif or a pure linework composition.  
  
I draw a lot of inspiration from the Art Nouveau movement of the 1890s, as well as wildlife and folklore from different parts of the world. I like creating tattoos that almost feel like vintage book illustrations: dynamic lines, framed scenes, fauna and flora, stylised portraits, romanticised objects – every tattoo becomes a piece of wordless storytelling.  
  
Whether you are looking for a somewhat minimalist personal piece, a decorative addition to your tattoo collection or an eye-catching body concept – I approach every project with the same care and diligence, no matter its size. “Your Body. Your Story” is the underlying mantra of all of my tattoo work and I strongly believe that you deserve to have your tattoo specifically tailored to you, no matter how simple, complex, small or large the design ends up being. I always strive to turn the tattooing process into a positive experience that leaves you with a unique piece of art in a style that carries a hint of that vintage whimsy and is immediately recognisable.
