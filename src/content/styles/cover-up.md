Cover-up tattoos are for people who already have a tattoo but do not like it anymore, maybe it is old, badly done or simply does not feel like you now. Cover-up work is not just “drawing over” an old tattoo, it is about building a new, clear design that is stronger and more readable than the unwanted piece below it.

Before we start a cover-up project, we look at your old tattoo together and talk honestly about what is realistic. Size, colour, placement and how dark the existing ink is will all affect the options, and sometimes lightening with laser can help. Most cover-up tattoos need to be bigger and more saturated so the new image is what people see first. Every cover-up in our studio is custom, with one simple goal: you leave with a tattoo you actually want to show, not hide.
