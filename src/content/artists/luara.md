Hi, I’m Luh, a half German, half Brazilian tattoo artist, born and raised in Frankfurt am Main and tattooing since 2015. From the very beginning I was drawn to everything colourful! I always wanted to develop a style that feels playful, bright and a little bit whimsical. My work lives somewhere between nature, fantasy and digital media: Japanese folklore, anime, videogames and all the small creatures you might find in the forest.

I love drawing animals (especially frogs and insects), fungi, fruit, flowers and plants, and turning them into designs with flow, that go with the shape of.your body . I mainly work in Neo Traditional Style and Anime & Manga, with a lot of colour and blending, but I also enjoy Floral & Botanic and Art Nouveau influences when a piece needs more flow, ornaments or stylised frames. Large-scale projects like back pieces or chest pieces are some of my favourite things to do!

My goal with every tattoo is to find beauty in small details, create a kind and relaxed space for the session, and design colourful work that reflects who you are while still feeling soft, imaginative and personal.
