slugOverride: fineline
order: 14
intro: "Ultra-delicate tattoos made with very fine needles and subtle detail. "
details: Fineline tattoos use ultra-thin lines and gentle shading. This style is
  popular for first tattoos, small words, minimal symbols, small geometric
  designs and discreet images. In our studio in the centre of Friedrichshain,
  our fineline artists pay close attention to detail and size so the tattoo
  looks clean behind the ear, on the wrist, along the ribs or on other subtle
  spots. If you want a light, elegant tattoo with a minimal look, fineline is a
  perfect match.
