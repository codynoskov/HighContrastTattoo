Hello, I’m Sinah. I work mostly in Blackwork, combining Floral & Botanic, Ornamental and Mandala & Geometric elements to create clean, structured designs. I especially enjoy large, symmetrical pieces like sternums, backs or torso projects, but I’m also happy to work on smaller tattoos, Dotwork details and cover-ups when an old piece needs a fresh start. I work with your Body flow and I prefer clear, readable designs that becomes a fusion with your Body.
