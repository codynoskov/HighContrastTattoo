Ed, our tattoo artist has been very attentive, friendly and competent. We felt very safe. Our tattoos, the very first ones, turned out to be beautiful and exactly how I and my husband imagined it. Just lovely. Getting an appointment was also easy. The studio has a great, bright atmosphere and the other artists have been very friendly too.
