Art Nouveau tattoos use smooth curves, decorative borders and stylised flowers. The style comes from art of the late 19th and early 20th century. In our Berlin studio, we often create designs with graceful figures, flowing hair, ornate frames and floral elements. These tattoos wrap around the body and look good on the thigh, collarbone, back, upper arm or ribs. If you like vintage posters and classic Art Nouveau artwork, this style can be a great base for your tattoo.
