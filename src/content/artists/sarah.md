name: "Sarah"
bio: "I'm a beginner artist based in Berlin (born/raised in Castrop-Rauxel). My tattoo style is kinda blackwork traditional. What matters most to me is that you feel comfortable — not just with your tattoo, but with the whole process around it. If you want to get to know me, my work and my personality, reach out on Instagram!"
fullBio: "My journey into tattooing started from a deep love for art and a desire to create meaningful work that people carry with them forever. Though I'm newer to the craft, I bring fresh perspective and genuine care to every piece I create."
