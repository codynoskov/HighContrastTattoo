Engraving is a style that copies the look of old prints: lots of fine lines, cross-hatching and a slightly worn texture. At our Berlin studio, the team takes inspiration from anatomical books, medieval illustrations, old maps, heraldry and classic engraved images. Clients who love history, classical art, medieval symbols and myths often choose this style. Our artists in Friedrichshain turn old drawings and historic engravings into tattoos while keeping the feeling of ink on paper. If you want a rare, vintage looking tattoo with a medieval touch, engraving is a great fit.
