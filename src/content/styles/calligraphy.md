Calligraphy & Script tattoos focus on how words, letters and numbers look on the skin. This style includes flowing scripts, bold lettering, initials, dates, quotes and longer phrases, from small wrist tattoos to larger text on the chest, ribs or back. We pay attention to line quality, spacing and size so your lettering stays readable, fits the placement and feels personal to you.
