name: White on Black
slugOverride: white-on-black
order: 6
intro: Bright, glowing details layered over dark blackwork or blackout.
details: White on Black tattoos use light ink over existing blackwork or
  blackout areas. This creates a glowing effect where lines, symbols and
  patterns appear on a deep black background. Clients who visit us in
  Berlin-Friedrichshain choose this style when they want something unusual or
  want to add new details to old black tattoos. It works well for upgrades,
  special effects and accents in big black projects.
