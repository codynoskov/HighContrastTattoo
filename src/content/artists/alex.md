Alex is a traditional tattoo artist with deep roots in the hardcore punk scene, working out of our studio in Berlin-Friedrichshain. His flash and customs are mostly smaller, patch-like pieces — bold cartoon-style tattoos with strong outlines, simple shapes and clear expressions that sit perfectly as little “badges” on the skin — but he’s just as comfortable scaling that look up into larger projects when the idea calls for it. Vegan and straight edge, he brings a focused, no-frills attitude to his sessions, making sure every design feels intentional, sits well on the body and still carries that raw, punk-driven character.
