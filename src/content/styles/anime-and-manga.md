Anime & Manga tattoos bring characters and scenes from anime and comics onto the skin. Fans choose this style when they want to keep the original expression, colours and mood of their favourite series or films. At our Friedrichshain studio, our artists turn key frames, posters or fan art into tattoos on the arm, leg, back or shoulder. If you want an anime tattoo, a piece for your favourite character or your own OC in this style, we can build it in this visual language.
