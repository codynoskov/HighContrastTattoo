Mandala & Geometric tattoos use symmetry, repeating shapes and clean lines to create balanced designs. These tattoos are great on the chest, back, shoulders, knees and hands, where they can circle around a centre or wrap around joints. Our artists plan each piece to follow the body so the pattern “sits” well on muscles and bones. If you like mandalas, sacred geometry and decorative patterns without characters, this style is a strong choice.
