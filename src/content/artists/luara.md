Her style features lots of colors and whimsy, inspired by nature, fantasy, and Japanese folklore. Anime and video games also have a huge influence on her art. She loves animals — especially frogs, insects, fungi, fruit, and everything found in the forest. She particularly enjoys large-scale projects like backpieces or chestpieces, where she can work with the shape of the body. Her biggest goal in life is to find beauty in everything and spread kindness.
