## Etched in Skin

Engraving-style tattooing pays homage to the printmaking techniques that illustrated books and documents for centuries. Using fine parallel lines of varying density to create depth and shadow, these tattoos evoke the aesthetic of woodcuts, copper engravings, and lithographs. The effect is scholarly, classical, and distinctly artistic.

## Historical Resonance

There's an inherent gravitas to Engraving-style work. These tattoos connect to a visual tradition that includes everything from Renaissance anatomical studies to Victorian scientific illustrations to the art of currency and official documents. For those drawn to historical aesthetics, classical imagery, or the beauty of fine linework, Engraving offers a style with genuine depth.
