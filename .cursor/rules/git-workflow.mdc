# Git Workflow

## Branch Strategy

**Always work on the `draft` branch first, then merge to `main`.**

- **draft** – Staging branch for new content and changes. Merge to main to publish.
- **main** – Production branch. Deployed to the live site. Pages CMS reads from main.

## Workflow

1. **Start on draft**: `git checkout draft` before making changes
2. **Commit to draft**: All new commits go to draft
3. **Push draft**: `git push origin draft`
4. **Publish**: Use the auto-merge workflow (or manual merge) to merge draft → main

## Important

- Do **not** commit directly to `main` — use draft first, then merge. The CMS reads from main.
- To sync draft with main (e.g., after accidental direct commits to main): merge main into draft, then push draft
- When syncing, you can ignore later commits to draft — prioritize bringing draft in line with main
