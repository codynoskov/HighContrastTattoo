Ornamental tattoos focus on decorative lines and shapes: filigree, lace, scrolls and jewel like elements. This style is perfect for highlighting the natural lines of the body, such as collarbones, chest, neck, stomach, shoulders, hips and hands. In our Berlin Friedrichshain studio, our artists design pieces that feel like necklaces, bracelets, ornamental collars or detailed borders, customised to your shape. If you want elegant tattoos without characters but with a strong focus on form and beauty, ornamental work is a very good option.
