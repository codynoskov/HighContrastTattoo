## Point by Point

Dotwork is the art of patience made visible. Every image, every gradient, every shadow is built from thousands of individual dots, each placed with intention. This meditative technique creates tattoos with a distinctive texture—soft gradients that seem to float on the skin, patterns that reveal new details the closer you look.

## Ancient Technique, Modern Expression

While dotwork has roots in ancient tattooing traditions from cultures around the world, contemporary artists have pushed the technique into new creative territory. From sacred geometry and mandalas to portraits and abstract compositions, dotwork proves that limitation breeds creativity. The constraint of working dot by dot opens up possibilities that traditional shading simply cannot achieve.
