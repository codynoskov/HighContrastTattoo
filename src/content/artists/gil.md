Hey, I’m Gil, born and raised in berlin. I tattoo in an engraving style that takes its cues from medieval woodcuts and copper engravings: dense linework, hatching, cross-hatching and a print-like feel, as if the design could have been taken from an old book or map.  
  
Most of my ideas grow out of nature and folklore, flowers, wild plants, animals, medieval imagery, relics and designs inspired by the Soulsborne universe. I like building tattoos that feel like little scenes or plates: a creature framed by lines, a symbolic object, or a small landscape you could imagine on a page of a weird old manuscript. Everything is black ink, lines and texture; no colour, just contrast and detail.  
  
I work across Engraving, Linework and Floral & Botanic, so we can keep things very minimal and linear or push deeper into heavy hatching and more complex compositions. Whether it’s something weird, a nature motif or a larger engraving-style piece, my aim is to give each tattoo that carved, hand-printed look and a mood that fits the person wearing it.
