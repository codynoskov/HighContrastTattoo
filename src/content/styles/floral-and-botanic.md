Floral & Botanic tattoos turn flowers, leaves and other plant elements into flowing designs that follow the body. At our studio in Berlin-Friedrichshain, many clients choose this style for soft, romantic or nature-inspired tattoos: branches, blossoms, wildflowers, vines and botanical compositions. We work on small pieces, like a single flower on the wrist, and on large projects on the thigh, ribs, shoulder or spine. If you like natural, elegant tattoos, this style gives you a lot of different ideas.
