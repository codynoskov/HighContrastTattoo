## The Power of the Line

Linework tattooing strips the art form to its essence. Every design is constructed from lines alone—varying in weight, spacing, and direction to create depth, movement, and form. Without shading or color to rely on, every line must be intentional, every stroke must carry the design. The result is tattoo work with a graphic clarity that's both timeless and contemporary.

## Minimal, Not Simple

Don't mistake restraint for simplicity. Linework demands exceptional precision and design skill. These tattoos must work as pure compositions, relying on balance, negative space, and the interplay of forms. From delicate botanical illustrations to bold geometric patterns, linework proves that limitation breeds creativity.
