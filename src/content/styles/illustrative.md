Illustrative tattoos take ideas from drawing, comics and book art: visible lines, sketch-like shading and expressive figures. In our Berlin-Friedrichshain studio, clients often choose this style for story-based tattoos, fairy-tale scenes, fantasy creatures and custom characters. The finished tattoo looks like a unique illustration on your skin. If you want your tattoo to tell a story or feel like real artwork, illustrative style is a strong choice.
