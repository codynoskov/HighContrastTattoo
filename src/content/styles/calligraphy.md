name: Calligraphy
slugOverride: calligraphy
order: 17
intro: Expressive lettering tattoos focused on the art of writing.
details: "Calligraphy tattoos are all about the style of the letters: hand-drawn
  scripts, bold strokes and custom fonts. This tattoo style is perfect for
  names, dates, quotes and single words where the look of the text is as
  important as the meaning. At our Friedrichshain studio in Berlin, our
  calligraphy artists pick the right script for the language, length of the
  phrase and place on the body, from a small word on the wrist to a full
  calligraphic sleeve. If you want your text tattoo to look like a piece of art,
  calligraphy is the right direction."
