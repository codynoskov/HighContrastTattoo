Neo Traditional mixes old school lines with rich colours and more detailed shading. Many clients choose this style when they want something bold and artistic: animals, portraits, skulls, daggers, characters and symbolic objects. Depending on the subject and colour palette, Neo Traditional can look very feminine and soft or very bold and masculine, so it works well for many different personalities. Our Neo Traditional artists build designs that look almost like illustrations or poster art. If you want a colourful sleeve, chest piece or leg tattoo with a lot of character, this style fits very well.
