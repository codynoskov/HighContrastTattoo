name: "Arseniy"
bio: "Born from hardcore punk — I've been tattooing since 2013. My Traditional and Old School tattoos are fast, bold, and built to last. You can choose from my collection of ready-made flash designs, or I'll be happy to bring your own idea to life. I specialize in creating pieces that honor the rich history of tattooing while adding my own contemporary twist."
fullBio: "From my roots in the hardcore punk scene, I've developed a tattooing style that values authenticity, craftsmanship, and community. Over a decade of experience has refined my technique, allowing me to execute Traditional and Old School designs with speed and precision without sacrificing quality."

  - title: "Style & Direction"
    paragraphs:
      - "My work spans a range of styles, from classic Traditional and Old School to more experimental approaches like White on Black and Neo-Tribal. What unites everything I do is a commitment to bold, lasting work that looks as good in twenty years as it does today."
      - "I'm particularly drawn to designs with strong cultural roots — whether that's American Traditional iconography, Tribal patterns, or the raw energy of punk aesthetics. Each piece carries meaning beyond its visual impact."
  - title: "Flash & Custom Work"
    paragraphs:
      - "My flash sheets are always growing, featuring designs inspired by everything from classic Americana to punk rock imagery. Flash pieces are available for walk-ins when my schedule allows, or you can book ahead to secure a specific design."
      - "Custom work is where I really shine. I love taking a client's vision and translating it into a tattoo that exceeds their expectations. The process typically involves a consultation, sketching phase, and final refinement before we put needle to skin."

    paragraphs:
      - "I'm available for appointments throughout the week. For smaller flash pieces, we can often get you in quickly. Larger custom work requires more lead time for design development and scheduling."
      - "I believe in transparent pricing and clear communication throughout the process. Reach out via the booking form or Instagram DM to discuss your project and get a quote."
