name: "Alex"
bio: "I'm a traditional tattoo artist rooted in the hardcore punk scene — vegan, straight edge, and a coffee lover. My work blends classic American traditional with contemporary influences, always aiming for bold lines and vibrant colors that stand the test of time."
fullBio: "I've been tattooing professionally for over a decade, drawing inspiration from the rich history of American traditional tattooing while adding my own modern twist. Every piece I create is designed to age beautifully, with bold lines and saturated colors that maintain their impact over time. My studio is a judgment-free zone where we can collaborate on bringing your vision to life."
