Graphic tattoos are built like design pieces: clean composition, strong geometry and a structure that is carefully planned from the start. This style works well for people who want clear, striking imagery on the skin, but it doesn't have to be minimal only. In our studio in Berlin Friedrichshain area, our artists create both very reduced designs and more complex "elegant chaos": layered shapes, broken grids, overlapping elements and script or lettering details that still feel controlled and intentional. If you like modern, city-style tattoos that range from ultra clean to creatively chaotic while still remaining visually balanced and aesthetically pleasing, graphic work is a very good direction.
