  - title: "Style & Direction"
    paragraphs:
      - "My engraving style pays homage to the master printmakers of the medieval and Renaissance periods. Using precise linework and careful shading, I recreate the look of woodcuts and copper engravings directly on skin. The result is tattoos that feel like living pieces of historical art."
      - "Nature themes dominate my portfolio — botanical illustrations, animal studies, and mythological creatures rendered with meticulous attention to detail. I also love creating pieces inspired by the dark fantasy aesthetic of games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne."
  - title: "Flash & Custom Work"
    paragraphs:
      - "While I do maintain a selection of flash designs, my work leans heavily toward custom pieces. The nature of engraving-style tattoos means each design benefits from being tailored to the specific placement and size we're working with."
      - "For custom work, I spend significant time researching historical references and developing original artwork. Expect the design process to take several weeks for complex pieces — the results are worth the wait."

  - title: "Booking & Sessions"
    paragraphs:
      - "Engraving-style tattoos require patience, both from the artist and the client. Sessions may run longer than traditional tattoos due to the detailed linework involved. I recommend breaking larger pieces into multiple sessions for comfort and optimal results."
      - "To book, reach out with your ideas and preferred placement. Include any reference images that inspire you — whether that's historical engravings, game artwork, or natural subjects you'd like to incorporate."
