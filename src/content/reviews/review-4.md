Super talented and friendly artists, great atmosphere, you feel right at home ❤️ This is the second time I've gotten a tattoo at High Contrast Tattoo by resident Sera Redwood who is a meticulous and patient artist, with a strong intuition for the placement of motifs and an understanding of one's preferences. She is technically skilled and can perform advanced line work, drawing directly on the skin without stencils before tattooing to connect multiple elements with geometric precision, etc. Highly recommend! 🙌🌟
