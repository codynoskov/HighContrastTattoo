Linework tattoos focus on clear outlines and simple shapes without heavy shading or colour. In our studio in Berlin, this style is great for people who like minimal, tidy and long-lasting designs. Our artists create everything from tiny icons to larger line-based pieces on arms, legs, chest or back. If you want simple but strong tattoo ideas with clear contours, linework is a very flexible option.
