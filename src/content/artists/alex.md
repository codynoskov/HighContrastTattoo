My name is Alex. I'm a traditional tattoo artist, rooted in the hardcore punk scene, vegan, straight edge, DIY, PMA. That ethos is a foundation of my identity. I like tattoos that are bright and bold, built on strong linework and solid packing so they read well and keep that look over time.

I mainly work in the traditional style, using classic old school shapes as a base for more personal motifs that inspire me, like music, cartoons, and video games. Most of my pieces are palm sized and designed to feel like patches on the skin: bold contours, simple shapes, and readable designs. Flash style tattoos, little bangers, and patchwork layouts are what I enjoy most, but we can also grow that look into bigger projects if you want to fill an arm or leg step by step.

Whether it’s a classic motif or a cartoon idea, I keep the process simple: we talk it through, adjust the design to your body, and then focus on clean execution without unnecessary extras.
